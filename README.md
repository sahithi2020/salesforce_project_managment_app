# Salesforce_Project_Managment_App
This Salesforce-based Project Management App streamlines end-to-end project workflows by leveraging custom objects, automation, Apex logic, and Lightning components. It supports role-based access, task tracking, milestone reporting, and external integrations via REST APIs. Built with scalable data modeling and secure deployment practices, the app includes dashboards, approval processes, and responsive UI for efficient collaboration across teams, clients, and managers within the Salesforce ecosystem.

Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis Goal: Understand project needs, industry practices, and define objectives.

Gather requirements from stakeholders (Managers, Clients, Team Leads) to understand expectations.
Identify challenges in manual project tracking like delays, duplicate entries, and unclear responsibilities.
Define key objectives: task management, resource allocation, automated alerts, and reporting.
Analyze roles and responsibilities: Admin, Project Manager, Team Member, Client.
Set measurable KPIs such as on-time completion % and resource utilization.

Phase 2: Org Setup & Configuration Goal: Prepare Salesforce environment for app development.

Create Salesforce Developer Org and configure company profile (timezone, currency, fiscal year).
Add users with proper profiles and roles hierarchy (Manager > Team Lead > Team Member).
Set Org-Wide Defaults (OWD) and sharing rules for secure collaboration.
Configure business hours, public holidays, and approval processes.
Apply permission sets for additional privileges and ensure role-based access.

Phase 3: Data Modeling & Relationships Goal: Design structured data architecture for project tracking.

Use standard objects (Contacts, Users) and create custom objects (Project, Task, Resource Allocation).
Define essential fields: Start/End Date, Priority, Progress %, and Status.
Set relationships (Lookup & Master-Detail) between Project → Task → Resource.
Design record types for different project methodologies (Agile, Waterfall).
Build page layouts and compact layouts for desktop and mobile access.

Phase 4: Process Automation (Admin) Goal: Automate workflows and maintain data integrity.

Create validation rules (e.g., Task end date > start date) and record-triggered flows for task assignment.
Automate project status updates based on task completion.
Set email alerts and in-app notifications for task assignments and approvals.
Schedule flows for reminders and follow-up task creation.
Apply dynamic field updates and approval processes to reduce manual effort.

Phase 5: Apex Programming (Developer) Goal: Implement complex logic beyond declarative tools.

Develop Apex classes for task allocation and project scheduling logic.
Use triggers to prevent duplicate assignments and ensure data consistency.
Execute SOQL queries and collections (List, Set, Map) for record handling.
Implement Batch Apex, Queueable Apex, and Future methods for bulk/async operations.
Write test classes ensuring >75% coverage and exception handling.

Phase 6: User Interface Development Goal: Create intuitive dashboards and apps for end-users.

Build Project Management App using Lightning App Builder with tabs for Projects, Tasks, Resources.
Design home page dashboards to display KPIs and progress tracking.
Design home page dashboards to display KPIs and progress tracking.
Create record pages linking tasks, resources, and client details.
Implement LWC components for search, filters, and real-time updates.
Ensure responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile usage.

Phase 7: Integration & External Access Goal: Connect Salesforce with external systems securely.

Configure Named Credentials, Remote Site Settings, and OAuth for external access.
Integrate REST APIs with tools like Jira/Trello for task syncing.
Use Platform Events and Change Data Capture for real-time updates.
Connect to external databases using Salesforce Connect.
Monitor API limits and implement error handling for failed integrations.

Phase 8: Data Management & Deployment Goal: Manage data efficiently and deploy configurations.

Use Data Import Wizard and Data Loader for demo and bulk data migration.
Apply duplicate rules and weekly backups to maintain data integrity.
Deploy configurations using Change Sets, Salesforce CLI (SFDX), or ANT Migration Tool.
Test changes in Sandbox before Production deployment.
Prepare rollback strategies to ensure safe releases.

Phase 9: Reporting, Dashboards & Security Review Goal: Monitor progress and enforce data security.

Create reports and dashboards for task tracking and project KPIs.
Configure dynamic dashboards with role-based visibility.
Implement field-level security and login restrictions for sensitive data.
Maintain audit trails to track admin activity.
Test access for all user roles to ensure proper permission setup.
Phase 10: Final Presentation & Demo Day Goal: Deliver the final solution and showcase functionality.

Prepare a presentation highlighting Problem → Solution → Benefits.
Conduct live demo showing project creation, task assignment, and reporting.
Explain automation, workflows, and dashboards to stakeholders.
Provide user manuals, documentation, and project handoff.
Record demo, collect feedback, and plan future enhancements for portfolio/GitHub.
